# Job Scheduler (Python)

This project is a simple backend job scheduler built in Python. It allows users to schedule tasks to run:

- Hourly (e.g., at the 15th minute of every hour)
- Daily (e.g., at 6:30 PM every day)
- Weekly (e.g., every Friday at 8:00 PM)

## How It Works
Each scheduled job prints "Hello World" to the console and logs it into a file named `job_output.txt` with a timestamp.

## Run the Scheduler

```bash
python job_scheduler.py
